# Face Recognition Authentication System

Welcome to the Face Recognition Authentication System repository. This project is a robust implementation of a biometric authentication system using face recognition technology. The system is designed to accurately verify the identity of individuals based on facial features, offering a secure and convenient authentication solution.

## Overview

The Face Recognition Authentication System offers the following features:

- **Face Recognition Method**: Utilizes state-of-the-art face recognition algorithms to accurately identify individuals.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Includes a user-friendly GUI for easy interaction and testing.
- **Real-time Recognition**: Provides real-time face recognition capabilities for various applications.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Implements evaluation metrics such as False Match Rate (FMR) and False Non-Match Rate (FNMR) to assess system performance.

## Usage

To use the Face Recognition Authentication System:

1. **Installation**: Ensure Python is installed on your system. better to use 3.12 version
2. **Dependencies**: Install necessary dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt` eg. opencv, face_recognition, tkinter.
3. **Run GUI Version**: Execute `python main2.py` for the GUI-based system.
4. **Run Real-time Version**: Execute `python main-video.py` for real-time face recognition.
